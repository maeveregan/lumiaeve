  some clouds
  18 May 2025

  some clouds are big. 
  some clouds are small. 
  some clouds move fast. 
  some clouds will stall. 

  some are heavy,
  so much they fall,
  down to the ground,
  as if they bawl. 

  some clouds cover,
  the beauty below. 
  some clouds inhibit,
  the light to flow. 

  above the clouds
  remember, dear
  the sun is strong 
  please, do not fear 

  no matter how long
  how dark, how deep. 
  they will move on,
  alas, youâ€™ll sleep. 

  light will break through,
  and rouse your soul. 
  rejoice to find, 
  heart strong and full.

  <pre>
  she has joy
  yet she is aware
  multitudes

  she has lived
  yet wants more
  unafraid

  she smiles
  but surely has cried
  confident

  she's alive
  the future can't hurt
  steadfast, stuanch
