  Your darkness was held and kept out of reach,
  a place where no one could touch it or preach. 
  Many years gone by thanks to damage control, 
  unable to know the result of the toll. 

  Truths may lie hidden and kept out of sight, 
  for unless they're held down, their ideas may take flight. 
  What happens when you quell, subdue, and repress?
  You're left with a burden in awful distress. 

  There are answers to pain, and you found yours true, 
  it let you get by and turn down your blue. 
  Your darkness was bright and could be seen from afar, 
  I thought just perhaps it'd leave but a scar. 

  I wouldn't say you've left, but you're certainly not here, 
  you made one last trip to escape from your fear. 
  Your cross be the bottle you bore and it fit,
  I know in my heart that you didn't just quit.

    <div class="poem-content">
  I have come to love and feel,
  I have come to catch, not release, from lovers reel. 
  No bonafide pursuits would seek renown, 
  and such, we should certainly turn down. 
  False love can oft be held on high, 
  but a fact that time surely will descry. 

  I have come to see and taste, 
  however not, I've come for lover's haste. 
  Ephemeral joy may catch the eye, 
  such capricious acts seen from the sky. 
  Though most must pass the hedonistic right, 
  alas, some souls find true delight.

  The space existing between you and me,
  is not as much, I'd hope you see.
  For the more we push ourselves apart,
  the more, you see, we are not smart. 
  The matter is now, not time or coin,
  and it calls for us to join. 
  In idea and humanistic right, 
  so that we make it through the night. 
  For the dark may drag our weary tail,
  instead, unite, my friend, rejoice, avail.

    Don't do what's right, don't do what's sane,
    don't participate in the mundane. 

    Wrongs, rights, and lefts, so arbitrary, 
    the heards, the masses, so contrary. 

    The greedy man, the participle,
    it's our culture, stupid, that you'll cripple. 

    So put down the future and brush off the past, 
    for the past has passed, we know it will last. 

    Until then meets now and now meets when, 
    let bygones stand witness to what's always been.

  I'm either too much or just not enough,
  honest, ironically, sometimes I bluff. 

  There's truth that bears pain, and pain that bears truth, 
  and pain that makes people fight nail and tooth. 

  One can be honest and still tell a lie,
  it's not their fault, but the people who pry. 

  For some truths need gtime, and others need light, 
  these truths come later, or else they'll bring fright. 

  People should act, be and feel as they please, 
  but sadly instead they often appease.

    <div class="poem-title">some clouds</div>

    <div class="poem-content">
  some clouds are big. 
  some clouds are small. 
  some clouds move fast. 
  some clouds will stall. 

  some are heavy,
  so much they fall,
  down to the ground,
  as if they bawl. 

  clouds inhibit,
  the light to flow,
  these clouds cover,
  beauty below.

  above the clouds,
  remember, dear,
  the sun is fierce, 
  please, do not fear 

  no mind how long,
  how dark, how deep. 
  they will move on,
  alas, youâ€™ll sleep. 

  light will break through,
  and rouse your soul. 
  rejoice to find, 
  heart strong and full.

  she has joy
  yet is aware
  multitudes

  she has lived
  yet wants more
  unafraid

  she smiles
  but surely has cried
  confident

  she's alive
  the future can't hurt
  steadfast, stuanch

  Pull on your cap at the first deep shiver,
  the sight of one's breath, fall will deliver.
  Ah, orange trees will be lit up ablaze,
  prepare for now, you will see cooler days. 

  Soon the branches be barren and light, 
  for only wonted and seasonal plight. 
  Overcast, don't mind the melancholy, 
  'fore too long, ye shall be jolly.
