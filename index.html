  Your darkness was held and kept out of reach,
  a place where no one could touch it or preach. 
  Many years gone by thanks to damage control, 
  unable to know the result of the toll. 

  Truths may lie hidden and kept out of sight, 
  for unless they're held down, their ideas may take flight. 
  What happens when you quell, subdue, and repress?
  You're left with a burden in awful distress. 

  There's answers to pain, and you found yours true, 
  it let you get by and turn down your blue. 
  Your darkness was bright and could be seen from afar, 
  I thought just perhaps it'd leave but a scar. 

  I wouldn't say you've left, but you're certainly not here, 
  you made one last trip to escape from your fear. 
  Your cross be the bottle you bore and it fit,
  I know in my heart that you didn't just quit.
